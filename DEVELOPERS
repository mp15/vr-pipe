perltidy and podtidy
--------------------
Before commiting work you should ensure that your code has been tidied by our
custom perltidy script called vrpipe-perltidy (found in the scripts
subdirectory) using our custom .perltidyrc file (found in the root directory).

For this to work you'll need to have Perl::Tidy installed, at least version
20120701.

It should also have it's POD tidied by standard podtidy (install Pod::Tidy, at
least version 0.10) with the option --columns 80.

eg.:
$ vrpipe-perltidy modules/VRPipe/[my_modified_file].pm
$ rm modules/VRPipe/[my_modified_file].pm.bak
$ podtidy --columns 80 --inplace --nobackup modules/VRPipe/[my_modified_file].pm
$ git add modules/VRPipe/[my_modified_file].pm
$ git commit

You can automate this process by installing the custom git hook
vrpipe-githook_tidy. This is based on App::githook_perltidy which you should
install first (for the purposes of installing its dependencies - you won't use
it directly).

After installation, install the hook (you only need to do this once):
$ vrpipe-githook_tidy install

Now you can just:
$ git add modules/VRPipe/[my_modified_file].pm
$ git commit
