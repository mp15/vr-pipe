VRPipe can be used on Amazon's cloud service on EC2 nodes.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
Note that EC2 support is currently experimental. See notes at the end of this
document.


INSTALLATION
------------

You should do installation and run vrpipe-server on an instance that has over
2GB of memory, eg. an m1.medium.

After installing VRPipe's CPAN dependencies normally (see README), you also need
to manually install the perl module VM::EC2
cpan> install VM::EC2

When configuring VPRipe during the 'perl Build.PL' phase:
# Choose 'ec2' as the production and testing scheduler, and supply your security
  credentials when asked. When asked to supply a list of instance types, if you
  don't use the default then ensure that at least one of the types you supply
  has more than 2GB of memory.
# The database you choose should my mysql; you can set up a MySQL server on
  Amazon with RDS: http://aws.amazon.com/rds/ (start with 5GB and increase its
  size later as needed; a micro.t1 instance may be sufficient): the 'host' you
  specify when VRPipe asks for one is the 'endpoint' given by RDS. Modify its
  security group by adding the EC2 security group you use for your EC2 instance.
# The log directories you configure (and any output roots you choose when
  using VRPipe in production) must be placed on a shared file system that is
  auto-mounted when the instance starts. It is up to you to create the shared
  file system and handle the mounting. (Theoretically you could instead use
  the 'local' scheduler instead of the ec2 scheduler, which would limit you to
  running everything on the 1 instance, but would not need a shared file system)

After installation, prior to testing, create ssh keys:
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
and self-authorise:
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2

Now create an image from the instance where you have installed everything you
need, then terminate it and launch a new instance based on the AMI you just
created. The security group of the instance should be similar to the default
security group in that it allows all TCP traffic on all ports through the
firewall from a 'source' of the security group id (ie. only from instances in
the cluster, not the outside world). You'll almost certainly also want to ssh
into the node, so should allow TCP port 22 with a 'source' of your externally-
facing IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 and rely on your private key for security).

Finally, continue with testing and beyond as per the README.


NOTES
-----

By default Amazon quotas you to a maximum of 20 EC2 instances. For real work
you probably want to get this increased:
http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request/

The test system is supposed to clean up after itself when the tests complete.
However a current issue can result in the vrpipe-server process not stopping,
which means the associated redis-server process and all instances launched
will still be running. You'll have to manually kill/terminate these processes
and instances.

It is possible that the current implementation will not scale efficiently when
using hundreds or thousands of nodes. Improved solutions may be coming in the
future...
