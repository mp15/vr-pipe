=head1 NAME

VRPipe - use VRPipe modules in your own Perl scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    perl -MVRPipe -e '$vrfile = VRPipe::File->get(path => shift); ...' /tmp/foo
    perl -MVRPipe=testing -e '...'
    
    use VRPipe 'production'; # same as 'use VRPipe;'   
    use VRPipe 'testing';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To use VRPipe in your scripts you have to choose the desired deployment and
load the schema. This module provides a convenient way of doing this. Simply
using it loads all VRPipe::Persistent modules (which account for the majority
of VRPipe modules), so you probably won't have to 'use' any others. Using the
"import" syntax you can also easily choose your deployment (production, which
is the default, or testing).
