VRPipe::File - describe and work with files on a filesystem

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<VRPipe> must know about all the files that are input into it, that it works
on, and that it outputs. This class stores metadata about files (both normal
filesystem metadata like size and modify time, as well as arbitrary metadata),
and also has some methods to work with files, like C<open()> and C<move()>.

It is important to always use the methods here when doing anything with a file
that B<VRPipe> has dealt with, especially in the case of moving files that are
pipeline step outputs. For example, if a step output is moved without B<VRPipe>
knowing about it, and then a subsequent step (perhaps in a different pipeline)
needs to use that file, B<VRPipe> will be forced to rerun the pipeline and
steps necessary to regenerate the required file. However if C<move()> in this
class is used to do the move, B<VRPipe> will know where the required file is
now and use it from its new location.

To avoid doing stats on disc to discover if a file exists (which can be very
slow and expensive on high-performance filesystems), this metadata is stored in
the B<VRPipe> database, so again, C<unlink()> in this class should be used if
you need to delete a file, not Perl's unlink(), or Unix B<rm>.

 Title   : move (alias mv)
 Usage   : $obj->move($dest);
 Function: Move this file to another path. dest receives $obj's metadata, and
           $obj knows it was moved_to $dest. $dest only inherits $obj's parent
           if $obj had one. Pre-checks if there is sufficient disk space at the
           destination, and also fails if destination has less that 5% disk
           space remaining globally, to avoid breaking certain filesystems.
 Returns : n/a

=head2 resolve
 
 Title   : move (alias mv)
 Usage   : my $real_file = $obj->resolve;
 Function: If this file was created as a symlink (using VRPipe::File->symlink),
           returns the VRPipe::File corresponding to the real file. If this file
           was moved somewhere else, returns the VRPipe::File corresponding to
           the current location. If neither of these is true, returns itself.
 Returns : VRPipe::File object

 Title   : copy (alias cp)
 Usage   : $obj->copy($dest);
 Function: Copy this file to another path, checking md5s to make sure the copy
           was perfect. $dest receives $obk's metadata. Pre-checks if there is
           sufficient disk space at the destination, and also fails if
           destination has less that 5% disk space remaining globally, to avoid
           breaking certain filesystems.
