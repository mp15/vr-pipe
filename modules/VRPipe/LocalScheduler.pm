VRPipe::LocalScheduler - a job scheduler for the local node

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For testing purposes, or for those without a compute cluster, this simple job
scheduler can be used instead of LSF et al. It implements a single queue of
jobs, and it just tries to blindly execute them on the local CPU, without
regard for their memory needs or time requirements.

Note that it is poorly tested and perhaps unreliable, so probably should not be
used in production or at scale.
