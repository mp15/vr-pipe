VRPipe::Scheduler - a generic interface to job scheduling systems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to manage the execution of command lines across the many nodes of a
compute cluster, some job scheduling system should be in place. Examples
include LSF and Grid Engine. B<VRPipe> submits the work it wants done to a
scheduler; this Scheduler provides a single consistent interface to all the
possible schedulers.

Currently only LSF is supported. Support for other shedulers can be added by
creating a C<VRPipe::Schedulers::[name]> class that implements the
C<VRPipe::SchedulerMethodsRole> role.

For doing work on the local machine when there isn't a cluster available (or
for testing purposes), there is also a 'Local' scheduler supplied with
B<VRPipe>.
