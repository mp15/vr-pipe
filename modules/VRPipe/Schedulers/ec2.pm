VRPipe::Schedulers::ec2 - interface to ec2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides L<Amazon
EC2|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html>-specific
command lines for use by L<VRPipe::Scheduler>.

It depends upon VM::EC2, which you must manually install.

For this to work the server must be running on an AMI that boots up to an
environment with a working VRPipe installation and all the software you need to
run. The VRPipe installation must be configured to use ec2 as the job
scheduler, and you must have provided the access and secret keys (which can be
found at https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials?) during the
'perl Build.PL' phase of VRPipe installation.
