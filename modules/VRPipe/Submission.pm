VRPipe::Submission - holds state for Jobs that need to be run

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<VRPipe::Job> holds a command line that needs to be executed, but to execute
it it must be passed to the system's job scheduler, which usually would like to
know the memory and time (etc.) requirements (L<VRPipe::Requirements>).

Submission associates Job with Requirements, and tracks scheduler-related
state. We have here the methods to retry a failed Job, and increase memory and
time requirements (associating with the Submission a new Requirements object)
if necessary.
