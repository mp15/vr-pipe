Genotype check:	PASSED	 # The status is 'confirmed'.
Mapped bases:	PASSED	 # At least 90.0% bases mapped after clipping (99.80%).
Duplicate reads:	PASSED	 # 8.0% or fewer reads were duplicates (0.98%).
Reads mapped in a proper pair:	PASSED	 # 80.0% or more reads that were mapped are in a proper pair (99.02%).
Error rate:	PASSED	 # The error rate is lower than 0.02 (0.00376721).
InDel ratio:	PASSED	 # The Ins/Del ratio is smaller than 0.82 (21689/29493).
InDel ratio minimum:	PASSED	 # The Ins/Del ratio is greater than 0.68 (20641/28164).
Insert size:	PASSED	 # Fail library, less than 80.0% of the inserts are within 25.0% of max peak (70.24%).
Insert size (rev):	PASSED	 # Fail library, 80.0% of inserts are not within 25.0% of the max peak (31.23%).
Overlap duplicate base percent:	PASSED	 # The percent of bases duplicated due to reads of a pair overlapping (1.3) is smaller than or equal to 4.
InDels per Cycle:	FAILED	 # Some indels per cycle exceed 8X of the median
Verdict:	PASSED
